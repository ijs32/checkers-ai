# CheckersAI

This is the most insane thing I have ever written. What was I thinking. Never got around to the model. I think my thought process was that feeding a modela bit representation of a checkers board would make learning favorable states easier, but this is still such an insane approach. 

No chance I ever come back to this implementation but funny to look at.
